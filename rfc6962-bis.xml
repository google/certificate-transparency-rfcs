    <abstract>
      <t>
        This document describes a protocol for publicly logging
the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as they are issued
or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit certification authority (CA)
activity and notice the issuance of suspect certificates as well as to audit
the certificate logs themselves. The intent is that eventually clients would
refuse to honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing
CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.
      </t>
      <t>
        Logs are network services that implement the protocol operations for
submissions and queries that are defined in this document.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Certificate transparency aims to mitigate the problem of misissued
certificates by providing append-only logs of issued certificates. The logs
do not need to be trusted because they are publicly auditable. Anyone may verify
the correctness of each log and monitor when new certificates are added to it.
The logs do not themselves prevent misissue, but
they ensure that interested parties (particularly those named in certificates)
can detect such misissuance. Note that this is a general mechanism, but in this
document, we only describe its use for public TLS server certificates issued by
public certification authorities (CAs).
      </t>
      <t>
        Each log consists of certificate chains, which can be submitted by anyone. It is expected that public CAs will contribute all their newly issued certificates to one or more logs, however certificate holders can also contribute their own certificate chains, as can third parties. In order to avoid logs being rendered useless by the submission of large numbers of spurious certificates, it is required that each chain ends with a trust anchor that is accepted by the log. When a chain is accepted by a log, a signed timestamp is returned, which can later be used to provide evidence to TLS clients that the chain has been submitted. TLS clients can thus require that all certificates they accept as valid are accompanied by signed timestamps.
      </t>
      <t>
        Those who are concerned about misissue can monitor the logs, asking
them regularly for all new entries, and can thus check whether domains they are
responsible for have had certificates issued that they did not expect. What
they do with this information, particularly when they find that a misissuance
has happened, is beyond the scope of this document, but broadly speaking, they
can invoke existing business mechanisms for dealing with misissued
certificates, such as working with the CA to get the certificate revoked, or with maintainers of trust anchor lists to get the CA removed. Of course, anyone who wants can monitor the logs and, if they
believe a certificate is incorrectly issued, take action as they see fit.
      </t>
      <t>
        Similarly, those who have seen signed timestamps from a particular log can later demand a proof of inclusion from that log. If the log is unable to provide this (or, indeed, if the corresponding certificate is absent from monitors' copies of that log), that is evidence of the incorrect operation of the log. The checking operation is asynchronous to allow TLS connections to proceed without delay, despite network connectivity issues and the vagaries of firewalls.
      </t>
      <t>
        The append-only property of each log is technically achieved using Merkle Trees, which can be used to show that any particular instance of the log is a superset of any particular previous instance. Likewise, Merkle Trees avoid the need to blindly trust logs: if a log attempts to show different things to different people, this can be efficiently detected by comparing tree roots and consistency proofs. Similarly, other misbehaviors of any log (e.g., issuing signed timestamps for certificates they then don't log) can be efficiently detected and proved to the world at large.

      <section title="Merkle Hash Trees" anchor="mht">
        <t>
          Logs use a binary Merkle Hash Tree for efficient auditing. The hashing algorithm used by each log is expected to be specified as part of the metadata relating to that log. We have established a registry of acceptable algorithms, see <xref target="hash_algorithms"/>. The hashing algorithm in use is referred to as HASH throughout this document and the size of its output in bytes as HASH_SIZE. The input to the Merkle Tree Hash is a list
of data entries; these entries will be hashed to form the leaves of the Merkle
Hash Tree. The output is a single HASH_SIZE Merkle Tree Hash. Given an ordered
list of n inputs, D[n] = {d(0), d(1), ..., d(n-1)}, the Merkle Tree Hash (MTH)
is thus defined as follows:
        </t>
        <t>
          The hash of an empty list is the hash of an empty string:
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          MTH({}) = HASH().
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          The hash of a list with one entry (also known as a leaf hash) is:
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          MTH({d(0)}) = HASH(0x00 || d(0)).
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          For n &gt; 1, let k be the largest power of two smaller than n (i.e., k &lt; n &lt;= 2k). The Merkle Tree Hash of an n-element list D[n] is then defined recursively as
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          MTH(D[n]) = HASH(0x01 || MTH(D[0:k]) || MTH(D[k:n])),
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          where || is concatenation and D[k1:k2] denotes the list {d(k1), d(k1+1),..., d(k2-1)} of length (k2 - k1). (Note that the hash calculations for leaves and nodes differ. This domain separation is required to give second preimage resistance.)
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that we do not require the length of the input list to be a
power of two. The resulting Merkle Tree may thus not be balanced; however, its
shape is uniquely determined by the number of leaves. (Note: This Merkle Tree is
essentially the same as the <xref target='CrosbyWallach'>history tree</xref>
proposal, except our definition handles non-full trees differently.)
        </t>
      <section title="Merkle Inclusion Proofs" anchor='merkle_inclusion_proof'>
        <t>
          A Merkle inclusion proof for a leaf in a Merkle Hash Tree is the shortest
list of additional nodes in the Merkle Tree required to compute the Merkle Tree
Hash for that tree. Each node in the tree is either a leaf node or is computed
from the two nodes immediately below it (i.e., towards the leaves). At each
step up the tree (towards the root), a node from the inclusion proof is combined
with the node computed so far. In other words, the inclusion proof consists of the
list of missing nodes required to compute the nodes leading from a leaf to the
root of the tree. If the root computed from the inclusion proof matches the true
root, then the inclusion proof proves that the leaf exists in the tree.
        </t>
        <t> Given an ordered list of n inputs to the tree, D[n] = {d(0), ..., d(n-1)}, the Merkle inclusion proof PATH(m, D[n]) for the (m+1)th input d(m), 0 &lt;= m &lt; n, is defined as follows:
        </t>
        <t>
          The proof for the single leaf in a tree with a one-element input list D[1] = {d(0)} is empty:
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          PATH(0, {d(0)}) = {}
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          For n &gt; 1, let k be the largest power of two smaller than n. The proof for the (m+1)th element d(m) in a list of n &gt; m elements is then defined recursively as
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          PATH(m, D[n]) = PATH(m, D[0:k]) : MTH(D[k:n]) for m &lt; k; and
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          PATH(m, D[n]) = PATH(m - k, D[k:n]) : MTH(D[0:k]) for m &gt;= k,
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          where : is concatenation of lists and D[k1:k2] denotes the length (k2 - k1) list {d(k1), d(k1+1),..., d(k2-1)} as before.

      </section>

      <section title="Merkle Consistency Proofs" anchor='consistency'>
        <t>
          Merkle consistency proofs prove the append-only property of the tree. A Merkle consistency proof for a Merkle Tree Hash MTH(D[n]) and a previously advertised hash MTH(D[0:m]) of the first m leaves, m &lt;= n, is the list of nodes in the Merkle Tree required to verify that the first m inputs D[0:m] are equal in both trees. Thus, a consistency proof must contain a set of intermediate nodes (i.e., commitments to inputs) sufficient to verify MTH(D[n]), such that (a subset of) the same nodes can be used to verify MTH(D[0:m]). We define an algorithm that outputs the (unique) minimal consistency proof.
        </t>
        <t>
          Given an ordered list of n inputs to the tree, D[n] = {d(0), ..., d(n-1)}, the Merkle consistency proof PROOF(m, D[n]) for a previous Merkle Tree Hash MTH(D[0:m]), 0 &lt; m &lt; n, is defined as:
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          PROOF(m, D[n]) = SUBPROOF(m, D[n], true)
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          The subproof for m = n is empty if m is the value for which PROOF was originally requested (meaning that the subtree Merkle Tree Hash MTH(D[0:m]) is known):
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          SUBPROOF(m, D[m], true) = {}
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
           The subproof for m = n is the Merkle Tree Hash committing inputs D[0:m]; otherwise:
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          SUBPROOF(m, D[m], false) = {MTH(D[m])}
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          For m &lt; n, let k be the largest power of two smaller than n. The subproof is then defined recursively.
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
If m &lt;= k, the right subtree entries D[k:n] only exist in the current tree. We prove that the left subtree entries D[0:k] are consistent and add a commitment to D[k:n]:
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          SUBPROOF(m, D[n], b) = SUBPROOF(m, D[0:k], b) : MTH(D[k:n])
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
If m > k, the left subtree entries D[0:k] are identical in both trees. We prove that the right subtree entries D[k:n] are consistent and add a commitment to D[0:k].
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          SUBPROOF(m, D[n], b) = SUBPROOF(m - k, D[k:n], false) : MTH(D[0:k])
          <vspace blankLines='1' />
          Here, : is a concatenation of lists, and D[k1:k2] denotes the length (k2 - k1) list {d(k1), d(k1+1),..., d(k2-1)} as before.
        </t>
        <t>
          The number of nodes in the resulting proof is bounded above by ceil(log2(n)) + 1.

        Some regard some DNS domain name labels within their registered domain space as private and security sensitive.

We define a mechanism to allow these private labels to not appear in public logs.

        <t>
          Since TLS clients only match the wildcard character to the complete leftmost label of the DNS domain name (see Section 6.4.3 of <xref target="RFC6125"/>), this approach would not work for a DNS-ID such as <spanx style="verb">top.secret.example.com</spanx>.

For example, if a certificate contains a DNS-ID of <spanx style="verb">top.secret.example.com</spanx>, then the corresponding precertificate could contain <spanx style="verb">?.?.example.com</spanx> instead, but not <spanx style="verb">top.?.example.com</spanx> instead.
        </t>
        <t>
          Wildcard <spanx style="verb">*</spanx> labels MUST NOT be redacted. However, if the complete leftmost label of a DNS-ID is <spanx style="verb">*</spanx>, it is considered redacted for the purposes of determining if the label to the right may be redacted. For example, if a certificate contains a DNS-ID of <spanx style="verb">*.top.secret.example.com</spanx>, then the corresponding precertificate could contain <spanx style="verb">*.?.?.example.com</spanx> instead, but not <spanx style="verb">?.?.?.example.com</spanx> instead.
        </t>
        <t>
          When a precertificate contains one or more redacted labels, a non-critical extension (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.11129.2.4.6, whose extnValue OCTET STRING contains an ASN.1 SEQUENCE OF INTEGERs) MUST be added to the corresponding certificate: the first INTEGER indicates the total number of redacted labels and wildcard <spanx style="verb">*</spanx> labels in the precertificate's first DNS-ID; the second INTEGER does the same for the precertificate's second DNS-ID; etc. There MUST NOT be more INTEGERs than there are DNS-IDs. If there are fewer INTEGERs than there are DNS-IDs, the shortfall is made up by implicitly repeating the last INTEGER. Each INTEGER MUST have a value of zero or more. The purpose of this extension is to enable TLS clients to accurately reconstruct the TBSCertificate component of the precertificate from the certificate without having to perform any guesswork.
        </t>
        <t>
          When a precertificate contains that extension and contains a <xref target="RFC6125">CN-ID</xref>, the CN-ID MUST match the first DNS-ID and have the same labels redacted.  TLS clients will use the first entry in the SEQUENCE OF INTEGERs to reconstruct both the first DNS-ID and the CN-ID.

      <t>
        A log is a single, append-only Merkle Tree of submitted certificate and precertificate entries.
      </t>
      <t>
        When it receives a valid submission, the log MUST return an SCT that corresponds to the submitted certificate or precertificate. If the log has previously seen this valid submission, it MAY return the same SCT as it returned before. (Note that if a certificate was previously logged as a precertificate, then the precertificate's SCT of type <spanx style="verb">precert_sct</spanx> would not be appropriate; instead, a fresh SCT of type <spanx style="verb">x509_sct</spanx> should be generated).
      </t>
      <t>
        An SCT is the log's promise to incorporate the submitted entry in its Merkle Tree no later than a fixed amount of time, known as the Maximum Merge Delay (MMD), after the issuance of the SCT. Periodically, the log MUST append all its new entries to its Merkle Tree and sign the root of the tree.
      </t>
      <t>
        Log operators MUST NOT impose any conditions on retrieving or sharing data from the log.

      <section title="Accepting Submissions">
        <t>
          Logs MUST verify that each submitted certificate or precertificate has a valid signature chain to an accepted trust anchor, using the chain of intermediate CA certificates provided by the submitter. Logs MUST accept certificates and precertificates that are fully valid according to <xref target="RFC5280">RFC 5280</xref> verification rules and are submitted with such a chain. Logs MAY accept certificates and precertificates that have expired, are not yet valid, have been revoked, or are otherwise not fully valid according to RFC 5280 verification rules in order to accommodate quirks of CA certificate-issuing software. However, logs MUST reject submissions without a valid signature chain to an accepted trust anchor. Logs MUST also reject precertificates that do not conform to the requirements in <xref target="Precertificates"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          Logs SHOULD limit the length of chain they will accept. The maximum chain length is specified in the log's metadata.
        </t>
        <t>
          The log SHALL allow retrieval of its list of accepted trust anchors (see <xref target="get-anchors"/>), each of which is a root or intermediate CA certificate. This list might usefully be the union of root certificates trusted by major browser vendors.

      <section title="Log Entries" anchor="log_entries">
        <t>
          If a submission is accepted and an SCT issued, the accepting log MUST store the entire chain used for verification. This chain MUST include the certificate or precertificate itself, the zero or more intermediate CA certificates provided by the submitter, and the trust anchor used to verify the chain (even if it was omitted from the submission). The log MUST present this chain for auditing upon request (see <xref target="get-entries"/>). This chain is required to prevent a CA from avoiding blame by logging a partial or empty chain.

      <t>
        Messages are sent as HTTPS GET or POST requests. Parameters for POSTs
and all responses are encoded as <xref target="RFC4627">JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON)
objects</xref>. Parameters for GETs are encoded as order-independent key/value
URL parameters, using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format described
in the <xref target="HTML401">"HTML 4.01 Specification"</xref>. Binary data is
<xref target="RFC4648">base64 encoded</xref> as specified in the individual
messages.
      </t>
      <t>
        Note that JSON objects and URL parameters may contain fields not specified here. These extra fields should be ignored.
      </t>
      <t>
        The &lt;log server&gt; prefix, which is part of the log's metadata, MAY include a path as well as a server name and a port.
      </t>
      <t>
        In practice, log servers may include multiple front-end machines. Since it is impractical to keep these machines in perfect sync, errors may occur that are caused by skew between the machines. Where such errors are possible, the front-end will return additional information (as specified below) making it possible for clients to make progress, if progress is possible. Front-ends MUST only serve data that is free of gaps (that is, for example, no front-end will respond with an STH unless it is also able to prove consistency from all log entries logged within that STH).
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, when a consistency proof between two STHs is requested, the front-end reached may not yet be aware of one or both STHs. In the case where it is unaware of both, it will return the latest STH it is aware of. Where it is aware of the first but not the second, it will return the latest STH it is aware of and a consistency proof from the first STH to the returned STH. The case where it knows the second but not the first should not arise (see the "no gaps" requirement above).
      </t>
      <t>
        If the log is unable to process a client's request, it MUST return an HTTP response code of 4xx/5xx (see <xref target="RFC2616"/>), and, in place of the responses outlined in the subsections below, the body SHOULD be a JSON structure containing at least the following field:
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="error_message:">
                A human-readable string describing the error which prevented the log from processing the request.
          </t>
          <t>
                In the case of a malformed request, the string SHOULD provide sufficient detail for the error to be rectified.
          </t>
          <t hangText="error_code:">
            An error code readable by the client. Some codes are generic and are detailed here. Others are detailed in the individual requests. Error codes are fixed text strings.
            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="not compliant">
                The request is not compliant with this RFC.

          e.g. In response to a request of <spanx style="verb">/ct/v2/get-entries?start=100&amp;end=99</spanx>, the log would return a <spanx style="verb">400 Bad Request</spanx> response code with a body similar to the following:

        "error_code": "not compliant",

      <t>
        Clients SHOULD treat <spanx style="verb">500 Internal Server Error</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">503 Service Unavailable</spanx> responses as transient failures and MAY retry the same request without modification at a later date.  Note that as per <xref target="RFC2616"/>, in the case of a 503 response the log MAY include a <spanx style="verb">Retry-After:</spanx> header in order to request a minimum time for the client to wait before retrying the request.

          If the version of <spanx style="verb">sct</spanx> is not v2, then a v2 client may be unable to verify the signature. It MUST NOT construe this as an error. This is to avoid forcing an upgrade of compliant v2 clients that do not use the returned SCTs.
        </t>
        <t>
          If a log detects bad encoding in a chain that otherwise verifies correctly then the log MAY still log the certificate but SHOULD NOT return an SCT. It should instead return the "bad certificate" error. Logging the certificate is useful, because <xref target="monitor">monitors</xref> can then detect these encoding errors, which may be accepted by some TLS clients.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that not all certificate handling software is capable of detecting all encoding errors (e.g. some software will accept BER instead of DER encodings in certificates, or incorrect character encodings, even though these are technically incorrect) .

        TLS servers MUST use at least one of the three mechanisms listed below to present one or more SCTs or inclusion proofs from one or more logs to each TLS client during TLS handshakes, where each SCT or inclusion proof corresponds to the server certificate or to a name-constrained intermediate the server certificate chains to. Three mechanisms are provided because they have different tradeoffs.
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A TLS extension (Section 7.4.1.4 of <xref target='RFC5246'/>) with type <spanx style="verb">transparency_info</spanx> (see <xref target="tls_transinfo_extension"/>). This mechanism allows TLS servers to participate in CT without the cooperation of CAs, unlike the other two mechanisms. It also allows SCTs and inclusion proofs to be updated on the fly.
          </t>
          <t>
            An <xref target='RFC6960'>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)</xref> response extension (see <xref target="ocsp_transinfo_extension"/>), where the OCSP response is provided in the <spanx style="verb">CertificateStatus</spanx> message, provided that the TLS client included the <spanx style="verb">status_request</spanx> extension in the (extended) <spanx style="verb">ClientHello</spanx> (Section 8 of <xref target='RFC6066'/>). This mechanism, popularly known as OCSP stapling, is already widely (but not universally) implemented. It also allows SCTs and inclusion proofs to be updated on the fly.
          </t>
          <t>
            An X509v3 certificate extension (see <xref target="cert_transinfo_extension"/>). This mechanism allows the use of unmodified TLS servers, but the SCTs and inclusion proofs cannot be updated on the fly. Since the logs from where the SCTs and inclusion proofs originated won't necessarily be accepted by TLS clients for the full lifetime of the certificate, there is a risk that TLS clients will subsequently consider the certificate to be non-compliant and in need of re-issuance.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        TLS servers SHOULD send SCTs or inclusion proofs from multiple logs in case one or more logs are not acceptable to the TLS client (for example, if a log has been struck off for misbehavior, has had a key compromise, or is not known to the TLS client).

        Here, <spanx style="verb">SerializedTransItem</spanx> is an opaque byte string that contains the serialized <spanx style="verb">TransItem</spanx> structure. This encoding ensures that TLS clients can decode each <spanx style="verb">TransItem</spanx> individually (so, for example, if there is a version upgrade, out-of-date clients can still parse old <spanx style="verb">TransItem</spanx> structures while skipping over new <spanx style="verb">TransItem</spanx> structures whose versions they don't understand).

TLS clients MUST implement all of the three mechanisms by which TLS servers may present SCTs (see <xref target="tls_servers"/>). TLS clients that support the <spanx style="verb">transparency_info</spanx> TLS extension SHOULD include it in ClientHello messages, with <spanx style="verb">extension_data</spanx> set to &lt;TBD&gt;.

        </t>
        <t>
          In addition to normal validation of the certificate and its chain, TLS clients SHOULD validate each supplied SCT by computing the signature input from the SCT data as well as the certificate and verifying the signature, using the corresponding log's public key. TLS clients MUST reject SCTs whose timestamp is in the future.
        </t>
        <t>
          TLS clients SHOULD also validate each supplied inclusion proof (see <xref target="verify_inclusion"/>), in order to audit the log.

          If the TLS client holds an STH that predates the SCT, it MAY, in the process of auditing, request a new STH from the log (<xref target="get-sth"/>), then verify it by requesting a consistency proof (<xref target="get-sth-consistency"/>). Note that if the TLS client uses <spanx style="verb">get-all-by-hash</spanx>, then it will already have the new STH.

          Monitors watch logs and check that they behave correctly. Monitors may additionally watch for certificates of interest. For example, a monitor may be configured to report on all certificates that apply to a specific domain name when fetching new entries for consistency validation.
        </t>
        <t>
          A monitor needs to, at least, inspect every new entry in each log it watches. It may also want to keep copies of entire logs. In order to do this, it should follow these steps for each log:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              Fetch the current STH (<xref target="get-sth"/>).
            </t>
            <t>
              Verify the STH signature.
            </t>
            <t>
              Fetch all the entries in the tree corresponding to the STH (<xref target="get-entries"/>).
            </t>
            <t>
              Confirm that the tree made from the fetched entries produces the same hash as that in the STH.
            </t>
            <t anchor="monitor_loop">
              Fetch the current STH (<xref target="get-sth"/>). Repeat until the STH changes.

            <t>
              Verify the STH signature.
            </t>
            <t>
              Fetch all the new entries in the tree corresponding to the STH
(<xref target="get-entries"/>). If they remain unavailable for an extended period, then this should be viewed as misbehavior on the part of the log.
            </t>
            <t>
              Either:
              <list style="numbers">

                  Verify that the updated list of all entries generates a tree with the same hash as the new STH.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        With CAs, logs, and servers performing the actions described here, TLS clients can use logs and signed timestamps to reduce the likelihood that they will accept misissued certificates.  If a server presents a valid signed timestamp for a certificate, then the client knows that a log has committed to publishing the certificate.  From this, the client knows that monitors acting for the subject of the certificate have had some time to notice the misissue and take some action, such as asking a CA to revoke a misissued certificate, or that the log has misbehaved, which will be discovered when the SCT is audited.  A signed timestamp is not a guarantee that the certificate is not misissued, since appropriate monitors might not have checked the logs or the CA might have refused to revoke the certificate.
      </t>
      <t>
        In addition, if TLS clients will not accept unlogged certificates, then site owners will have a greater incentive to submit certificates to logs, possibly with the assistance of their CA, increasing the overall transparency of the system.
      </t>
      <section title="Misissued Certificates">
        <t>
          Misissued certificates that have not been publicly logged, and thus do not have a valid SCT, are not considered compliant (so TLS clients may decide, for example, to reject them). Misissued certificates that do have an SCT from a log will appear in that public log within the Maximum Merge Delay, assuming the log is operating correctly. Thus, the maximum period of time during which a misissued certificate can be used without being available for audit is the MMD.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Detection of Misissue">
        <t>
          The logs do not themselves detect misissued certificates; they rely
instead on interested parties, such as domain owners, to monitor them and take
corrective action when a misissue is detected.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Redaction of Public Domain Name Labels">
        <t>
          CAs SHOULD NOT redact domain name labels in precertificates such that the entirety of the domain space below the unredacted part of the domain name is not owned or controlled by a single entity
(e.g. <spanx style="verb">?.com</spanx> and
<spanx style="verb">?.co.uk</spanx> would both be problematic). Logs
MUST NOT reject any precertificate that is overly redacted but which is
otherwise considered compliant. It is expected that monitors will treat overly
redacted precertificates as potentially misissued. TLS clients MAY reject a
certificate whose corresponding precertificate would be overly redacted, perhaps using the same mechanism for determining whether a wildcard in a domain name of a certificate is too broad.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Misbehaving Logs">
        <t>
          A log can misbehave in two ways: (1) by failing to incorporate a
certificate with an SCT in the Merkle Tree within the MMD and (2) by
violating its append-only property by presenting two different, conflicting
views of the Merkle Tree at different times and/or to different parties. Both
forms of violation will be promptly and publicly detectable.
        </t>
        <t>
          Violation of the MMD contract is detected by log clients requesting a
Merkle audit proof for each observed SCT. These checks can be asynchronous and
need only be done once per each certificate. In order to protect the clients'
privacy, these checks need not reveal the exact certificate to the log. Clients
can instead request the proof from a trusted auditor (since anyone can compute
the audit proofs from the log) or request Merkle proofs for a batch of
certificates around the SCT timestamp.
        </t>
        <t>
          Violation of the append-only property can be detected by clients comparing their instances of the Signed Tree Heads. As soon as two conflicting Signed Tree Heads for the same log are detected, this is cryptographic proof of that log's misbehavior. There are various ways this could be done, for example via gossip (see http://trac.tools.ietf.org/id/draft-linus-trans-gossip-00.txt) or peer-to-peer communications or by sending STHs to monitors (who could then directly check against their own copy of the relevant log).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Deterministic Signatures">
        <t>
          Logs are required to use deterministic signatures for the following reasons:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Using non-deterministic ECDSA with a predictable source of randomness means that each signature can potentially expose the secret material of the signing key.
            </t>

              Clients that gossip STHs or report back SCTs can be tracked or traced if a log was to produce multiple STHs or SCTs with the same timestamp and data but different signatures.

      <section title="Multiple SCTs">
        <t>
          TLS servers may wish to offer multiple SCTs, each from a different log.
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              If a CA and a log collude, it is possible to temporarily hide misissuance from clients. Including SCTs from different logs makes it more difficult to mount this attack.
            </t>
            <t>
              If a log misbehaves, a consequence may be that clients cease to trust it. Since the time an SCT may be in use can be considerable (several years is common in current practice when the SCT is embedded in a certificate), servers may wish to reduce the probability of their certificates being rejected as a result by including SCTs from different logs.
            </t>
            <t>
              TLS clients may have policies related to the above risks requiring servers to present multiple SCTs. For example <xref target="Chromium.Log.Policy">Chromium</xref> currently requires multiple SCTs to be presented with EV certificates in order for the EV indicator to be shown.
